## Overview
This project aims to utilize the [xLSTM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04517) 
block architecture for short, medium and long timeframe prediction of stock 
prices. xLSTM blocks, and in particular mLSTM blocks, boast improvements over 
traditional LSTM blocks and Transformer capabilities, mainly due to their matrix 
memory and covariance update rule. To take full advantage of these improved capabilities, 
we constructed a model specifically designed for prediction of time series with non-stationary 
distributions. We based our design on [xLSTMTime](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10240), with some 
modifications and adaptations.
