## Overview
This project aims to utilize the [xLSTM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04517) 
block architecture for prediction of stock prices.
xLSTM blocks, and in particular mLSTM blocks, boast improvements over 
traditional LSTM blocks and Transformer capabilities, mainly due to their matrix 
memory and covariance update rule. To take full advantage of these improved capabilities, 
we constructed a model specifically designed for prediction of time series with non-stationary 
distributions. We based our design on [xLSTMTime](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10240), with some 
modifications and adaptations.

## How to Run
Download the notebook and run in Google Colaboratory.

## Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
For better comparison to similar previous projects, the model was trained on the Coca-Cola daily data, obtained through ``` yfinance ``` API.
using the following features: Open, High, Low, Close and Adjusted Close prices, and the daily Volume.
Data preprocessing included applying a simple moving average with window of length 5 and transforming the prices to their natural logarithm.
Due to the length of the time series, we opted to assign only 64% to training, 16% to validation and the remaining 20% to testing.

## Model Architecture
As recommended by [xLSTMTime](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10240), the architecture we used is as depicted in the
following figure.

## Results
When viewing the forecast against the ground truth prices for the whole duration of the time series, as shown in the following figure, the model's prediction capabilities are quite impressive:

A closer look into the performance over the **test set** reveals the deviations and inaccuracies of the prediction:

Taking the *Coca-Cola*-trained model and forecasting prices of other stocks from different market sectors
yield impressive results as well.

Lastly, we experimented with autoregressively forecasting the *Coca-Cola* price 100 days into the future,
resulting in non-satisfactory performance:
